[![R-CMD-check](https://github.com/kevinwang09/learningtower/actions/workflows/R-CMD-check.yaml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/kevinwang09/learningtower/actions/workflows/R-CMD-check.yaml)

The goal of `learningtower` is to provide a user-friendly R package to provide easy access to a subset of variables from PISA data collected from the [OECD](https://www.oecd.org/pisa/data/). Version `r utils::packageVersion("learningtower")` of this package provides the data for the years `r learningtower:::data_range()`. The survey data is published every three years. This is an excellent real world dataset for data exploring, data visualizing and statistical computations.

## What is PISA?

<p align="center">
  <img width="300" height="300" src="man/figures/pisa_image.png">
</p>


The Programme for International Student Assessment (PISA) is an international assessment measuring student performance in reading, mathematical and scientific literacy.

PISA assesses the extent to which 15-year-old students have acquired some of the knowledge and skills that are essential for full participation in society, and how well they are prepared for lifelong learning in the areas of reading, mathematical and scientific literacy.

In 2022, PISA involved 79 countries and 600,000+ students worldwide.

Read more about the Programme [here](https://www.oecd.org/pisa/aboutpisa/).


## Installation

You can install the `learningtower` package from [CRAN](https://CRAN.R-project.org) with:

``` r
install.packages("learningtower")
```

To install the development version of `learningtower` from [GitHub](https://github.com/) use:

``` r
devtools::install_github("kevinwang09/learningtower")
```

## Data Description

The `learningtower` gives access to a subset of variables from PISA data originally collected and are available from [OECD](https://www.oecd.org/pisa/data/), collected on a three year basis.

The `learningtower` package contains mainly three datasets:

+ `student`
+ `school`
+ `countrycode`

This provides us with information about the students scores in mathematics, reading and science. Their school details, and which country they are from. The number of entries for the `student` and `school` data are shown below.

```{r, eval=FALSE, echo=FALSE}
library(learningtower)
student = load_student("all")
data(school)

library(dplyr)

student_summary <- student %>%
  group_by(year) %>%
  tally(name = "Number of Students")

school_summary <- school %>%
  group_by(year) %>%
  tally(name = "Number of Schools")

combined_summary <- full_join(student_summary, school_summary, by = "year")

knitr::kable(combined_summary)
```

| Year | Number of Students | Number of Schools |
|------|--------------------:|------------------:|
| 2000 |             127,236 |            8,526 |
| 2003 |             276,165 |           10,274 |
| 2006 |             398,750 |           14,365 |
| 2009 |             515,958 |           18,641 |
| 2012 |             480,174 |           18,139 |
| 2015 |             519,334 |           17,908 |
| 2018 |             612,004 |           21,903 |
| 2022 |             613,744 |           21,629 |

### Student Dataset

The `student` dataset comprises of the scores from the triennial testing of 15-year-olds worldwide. In addition, this dataset contains interesting information on their parents qualifications, family wealth, gender, and possession of computers, internet, cars, books, rooms, desks, and similar other variables.

The full dataset is approximately 50MB in size, which is much larger than the CRAN's allowed package size limit. As the result, the package itself only includes a random 50 rows from the [38 OECD countries](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OECD#Member_countries), for each of the survey years. i.e. `student_subset_2000`, `student_subset_2003` etc. 

The `student` subset dataset can be loaded easily. See `?student` for detailed information on the measured variables. 

```{r}
library(learningtower)

data(student_subset_2018)
dim(student_subset_2018)
```

The entire `student` data can be downloaded using the `load_student` function. 

```{r, eval=FALSE}
#load the entire student data for a single year
student_data_2018 <- load_student(2018)

#load the entire student data for two of the years (2012, 2018)
student_data_2012_2018 <- load_student(c(2012, 2018))

#load the entire student data
student_data_all <- load_student("all")
```

Note that because of changing data specification over the survery years, not all variables were measured consistently across the years.

</p>

### School Dataset

The `school` dataset comprises school weight and other information such as the funding distribution of the schools, whether the school is private or public, the enrollment of boys and girls, the school size, and similar other characteristics of interest of different schools these 15-year-olds attend throughout the world.

- The school subset dataset can be loaded as follows

```{r}
# loading the school data
data(school)
```

See `?school` for more information on the different variables present in the the school dataset.

</p>

### Countrycode Dataset

The countrycode dataset contains mapping of the [country ISO code to the country name](https://www.oecd.org/pisa/sitedocument/PISA-2015-Technical-Report-Readers-Guide.pdf). More information on the participating countries can be found [here](https://www.oecd.org/pisa/aboutpisa/pisa-participants.htm).

```{r}
# loading the countrycode data
data(countrycode)
head(countrycode)
```

See `?countrycode` for more detailed information on the countries that participated in the PISA experiment.

## Exploring the data

In the plot shown below, shows the weighted mean of mathematics scores of these 15 year old students for a few selected countries over the available years.

```{r, eval = FALSE, echo = FALSE}
library(dplyr)
library(learningtower)

student <- load_student("all")

p = student |>
  dplyr::filter(country %in% c("SGP","CAN", "FIN", "NZL",
                               "USA", "JPN", "GBR", "AUS")) |>
  group_by(year, country) |>
  summarise(math = weighted.mean(math, stu_wgt, na.rm=TRUE)) |>
  ggplot(aes(x=year, y=math, group=country, color = country)) +
  geom_line(alpha=0.6, linewidth = 2) +
  geom_point(alpha=0.6, size=3)+
  ylim(c(450, 600)) +
  theme_minimal() +
  labs(x = "Year",
       y = "Score",
       title = "Math Scores 2000 - 2022") +
  theme(text = element_text(size=10),
        legend.title = element_blank()) +
  scale_color_brewer(palette = "Dark2")

## Motivation for `learningtower`

+ The PISA 2018 results were released on 3 December 2019. This led to wringing of hands in the Australian press, with titles of stories like [Vital Signs: Australia's slipping student scores will lead to greater income inequality](https://theconversation.com/vital-signs-australias-slipping-student-scores-will-lead-to-greater-income-inequality-128301) and [In China, Nicholas studied maths 20 hours a week. In Australia, it's three](https://www.smh.com.au/education/in-china-nicholas-studied-maths-20-hours-a-week-in-australia-it-s-three-20191203-p53ggv.html).

<p align="center">
  <img width="720" height="360" src="man/figures/conversation_holden.png">
</p>

+ Australia's neighbours, New Zealand and Indonesia, are also worrying: [New Zealand top-end in OECD's latest PISA report but drop in achievements 'worrying'](https://www.stuff.co.nz/national/education/117890945/new-zealand-topend-in-oecds-latest-pisa-report-but-drop-in-achievements-worrying), [Not even mediocre? Indonesian students score low in math, reading, science: PISA report](https://www.thejakartapost.com/news/2019/12/04/not-even-mediocre-indonesian-students-score-low-in-math-reading-science-pisa-report.html).

+ The data from this survey and all of the surveys conducted since the first collection in 2000, is publicly available. We decided to have made a more convenient subset of the data available in a new R package, called `learningtower`
